# Clonesig_analysis
This repository contains all the scripts used to provide the results for the CloneSig article.

AbÃ©cassis, Judith, Fabien Reyal, and Jean-Philippe Vert. "CloneSig: Joint inference of intra-tumor heterogeneity and signature deconvolution in tumor bulk sequencing data." BioRxiv (2019): [825778](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/825778v2).


The folder ```signature_code``` contains most of the code, with the master script in the bash script ```run_all.sh```. It is not advised to execute it all at once, considering the run time, and the paths to change (python virtual environments, paths to executables etc).

The folder ```notebooks``` contains notebooks and scripts in which the final analyses are generated. The tables used to generate those results are in the folder ```result_tables```.

The folder ```external_data``` contains data from external sources that were useful to carry out the project. A specific readme is included to provide the origin of each file.

It should be noted that more complete and up-to-date instructions of the CloneSig python package can be found [here](https://github.com/judithabk6/clonesig). Feel free to get in touch or to open an issue if you have any question or suggestion.


#### Installation and dependencies
this project uses many packages. Here is a list of the most important ones. Requirement (```python27_requirements.txt``` and ```python36_requirements.txt```) files are provided to use with pip and setup two virtual environnments for Python 2.7 and 3.6 (or conda for some specific packages, in particular ```mkl``` and ```PyClone```). Here is a list of the main ones, including some that can be installed with pip (specified). Code was run with R version 3.3.2, and Python 3.6.8 (Anaconda installation), except to run PyClone (Python 2.7.9). All computation was performed under a Centos distribution, with torque as scheduler.
